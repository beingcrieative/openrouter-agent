## Responses

Responses are largely consistent with the [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). This means that `choices`
is always an array, even if the model only returns one completion. Each choice will contain a `delta`
property if a stream was requested and a `message`
property otherwise. This makes it easier to use the same code for all models.

At a high level, **OpenRouter normalizes the schema across models** and providers so you only need to learn one.

### Response Body

Note that `finish_reason`
will vary depending on the model provider. The `model`
property tells you which model was used inside the underlying API.

Here's the response schema as a TypeScript type:

`// Definitions of subtypes are below type Response = { id: string; // Depending on whether you set "stream" to "true" and // whether you passed in "messages" or a "prompt", you // will get a different output shape choices: (NonStreamingChoice | StreamingChoice | NonChatChoice)[]; created: number; // Unix timestamp model: string; object: 'chat.completion' | 'chat.completion.chunk'; system_fingerprint?: string; // Only present if the provider supports it // Usage data is always returned for non-streaming. // When streaming, you will get one usage object at // the end accompanied by an empty choices array. usage?: ResponseUsage; };`
```
// If the provider returns usage, we pass it down
// as-is. Otherwise, we count using the GPT-4 tokenizer.
type ResponseUsage = {
/** Including images and tools if any */
prompt_tokens: number;
/** The tokens generated */
completion_tokens: number;
/** Sum of the above two fields */
total_tokens: number;
}
```
`// Subtypes: type NonChatChoice = { finish_reason: string | null; text: string; error?: ErrorResponse; }; type NonStreamingChoice = { finish_reason: string | null; // Depends on the model. Ex: 'stop' | 'length' | 'content_filter' | 'tool_calls' message: { content: string | null; role: string; tool_calls?: ToolCall[]; }; error?: ErrorResponse; }; type StreamingChoice = { finish_reason: string | null; delta: { content: string | null; role?: string; tool_calls?: ToolCall[]; }; error?: ErrorResponse; }; type ErrorResponse = { code: number; // See "Error Handling" section message: string; metadata?: Record<string, unknown>; // Contains additional error information such as provider details, the raw error message, etc. }; type ToolCall = { id: string; type: 'function'; function: FunctionCall; };`
Here's an example:

`{ "id": "gen-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "choices": [ { "finish_reason": "stop", // Different models provide different reasons here "message": { // will be "delta" if streaming "role": "assistant", "content": "Hello there!" } } ], "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 4, "total_tokens": 4 }, "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo" // Could also be "anthropic/claude-2.1", etc, depending on the "model" that ends up being used }`

### Querying Cost and Stats

The token counts that are returned in the completions API response are NOT counted with the model's native tokenizer. Instead it uses a normalized, model-agnostic count.

For precise token accounting using the model's native tokenizer, use the `/api/v1/generation`
endpoint.

You can use the returned `id`
to query for the generation stats (including token counts and cost) after the request is complete. This is how you can get the cost and tokens for *all models and requests*, streaming and non-streaming.

`const generation = await fetch( "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/generation?id=$GENERATION_ID", { headers } ) await generation.json() // OUTPUT: { data: { "id": "gen-nNPYi0ZB6GOK5TNCUMHJGgXo", "model": "openai/gpt-4-32k", "streamed": false, "generation_time": 2, "created_at": "2023-09-02T20:29:18.574972+00:00", "tokens_prompt": 24, "tokens_completion": 29, "native_tokens_prompt": 24, "native_tokens_completion": 29, "num_media_prompt": null, "num_media_completion": null, "origin": "https://localhost:47323/", "total_cost": 0.00492, "cache_discount": null, ... } };`
Note that token counts are also available in the `usage`
field of the response body for non-streaming completions.

### SSE Streaming Comments

For SSE streams, we occasionally need to send an [SSE comment](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#authoring-notes) to indicate that OpenRouter is processing your request. This helps prevent connections from timing out. The comment will look like this:

`: OPENROUTER PROCESSING`
Comment payload can be safely ignored per the [SSE specs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation). However, you can leverage it to improve UX as needed, e.g. by showing a dynamic loading indicator.

Some SSE client implementations might not parse the payload according to spec, which leads to an uncaught error when you `JSON.stringify`
the non-JSON payloads. We recommend the following clients:
