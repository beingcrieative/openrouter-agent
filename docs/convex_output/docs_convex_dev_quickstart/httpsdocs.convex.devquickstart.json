Then, we'll get an example app up and running in a few minutes. We'll explore how it works, improve it together, and along the way learn the fundamentals of how to build your own projects in Convex.\n\n## Explore the Convex dashboard[](#explore-the-convex-dashboard)\nBefore you get started we want to give you a quick tour of our dashboard. Click on the button below to connect your Github and create a Convex account.\n\n## Get started with an in-dashboard tutorial\nIn this tutorial you will learn about how to interact with data in the dashboard and run functions. Once finished with the tutorial, you will be directed back here to continue on with a new project.\n\n## Start developing with Convex[](#start-developing-with-convex)\n## Before you begin: You'll need Node.js 16+ and Git\nEnsure you have Node.js version 16 or greater installed on your computer. You\ncan check your version of Node.js by running `node --version`\nin your terminal.\nIf you don't have the appropriate version of Node.js installed,\n[install it from the Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en)\n\nIn addition, this walkthrough requires Git, so verify you have it installed by\nrunning `git -v`\nin your terminal. If not, head over to the\n[Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for\ninstallation instructions.\n\nFirst, clone the example project repo from GitHub:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/get-convex/convex-tour-chat.git`\ncd convex-tour-chat\nIn the project root directory, install `convex`\nand the other project\ndependencies with `npm`\n:\n\n`npm install`\nFinally, this app's `dev`\nnpm command sets up Convex and then runs the web app:\n\n`npm run dev`\nDuring setup, you'll see that Convex uses your GitHub account for authentication. Sign into Convex with GitHub and then accept the default project setup prompts.\n\n**Make sure you keep this command ( npm run dev) running in the background\nthroughout this tutorial.** It's running both the dev web server for the\nfrontend as well as the\n`convex`\ncommand in the background to keep your backend\nin sync with your local codebase.Once your app is up and running, open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)\nand check it out. You'll see a chat frontend running in Node.js on your\ncomputer. This frontend connects to your new Convex backend hosted in the cloud,\nwhich stores and retrieves the app's chat messages:\n\nSince we just checked this codebase out, you may wonder how it knows to connect\nto *your specific* Convex backend? Information about your project backend was\nwritten to the `.env.local`\nfile when we set up the project. When the app starts\nup, the Convex client library uses an environment variable to connect to your\nbackend.\n\nFor extra fun, pop up a couple of browser windows and watch Convex relay chat messages between them:\n\nThroughout the rest of this tutorial, we're going to learn more about how this app works and learn about how to build apps in general using Convex. We'll make a few improvements to this app as we go, and finish by integrating some cool GPT AI.\n\n## Dive into more projects first?\nIf instead you want to see other example projects, head on over to our\n[Template Gallery](https://convex.dev/templates), or see our\n[Quickstarts](/quickstarts).\n\nWe still recommend you make your way back here eventually to learn the basics about how Convex works and how to \"think in Convex.\" Most developers find that once they master the concepts in this tutorial, they're extremely comfortable making new application architectures on the platform.\n\n## Convex main ingredients[](#convex-main-ingredients)\nIn the next three parts, we'll use this chat app to walk through the following fundamental platform concepts:\n\n-\n**The Convex reactor**\nFirst we'll explore the beating heart of Convex, a custom cloud-hosted reactive database called \"the reactor.\" The reactor combines document-relational**tables**with deterministic TypeScript**query**and**mutation**functions. -\n**Convex and your app**\nNext, we'll dive into the app's frontend code, and explore how to use Convex**client libraries**to seamlessly connect your hosted backend to your app. -\n**The platform in action**\nFinally, we'll touch on the broader backend features outside the reactor that work together to create a comprehensive backend platform. In particular, we'll go deep on**actions**, Convex's way to create powerful jobs that integrate your app with third-party services & APIs.\nLet's go!",
