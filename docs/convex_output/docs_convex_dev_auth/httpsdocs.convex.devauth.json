Since it doesn't require signing up for another service it's the quickest way to get auth up and running.\n\nConvex Auth is currently a [beta\nfeature](/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature\nrequests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!\n\nSupport for Next.js is under active development. If you'd like to help test this\nexperimental support please [give it a try](https://labs.convex.dev/auth)!\n\n## Third-party authentication platforms[](#third-party-authentication-platforms)\nLeveraging a Convex integration with a third-party auth provider provides the most comprehensive authentication solutions. Integrating another service provides a ton of functionality like passkeys, two-factor auth, spam protection, and more on top of the authentication basics.\n\n[Clerk](/auth/clerk)is newer and has better Next.js and React Native support[Auth0](/auth/auth0)is more established with more bells and whistles[Custom Auth Integration](/auth/advanced/custom-auth)allow any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider to be used for authentication\nAfter you integrate one of these, learn more about accessing authentication\ninformation in [Functions](/auth/functions-auth) and storing user\ninformation in the [Database](/auth/database-auth).\n\n## Debugging[](#debugging)\nIf you run into issues consult the [Debugging](/auth/debug) guide.",
