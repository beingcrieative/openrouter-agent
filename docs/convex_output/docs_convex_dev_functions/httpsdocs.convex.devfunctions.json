Everything you do in the Convex\nbackend starts from functions.\n\nThere are three types of functions:\n\n[Queries](/functions/query-functions)read data from your Convex database and are automatically cached and subscribable (realtime, reactive).[Mutations](/functions/mutation-functions)write data to the database and run as a transaction.[Actions](/functions/actions)can call Open AI, Stripe, Twilio, or any other service or API you need to make your app work.\nYou can also build [HTTP actions](/functions/http-actions) when you\nwant to call your functions from a webhook or a custom client.",
